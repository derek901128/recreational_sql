I love SQL. I wanna do more things with it. Hence the repo. 

1. Tic Tac Toe
   -> All the moves are randomized each time the query is run, hence the result will be different each time.
   -> The moves the randomized in the sense that they're not made not based on the state of the game, but purely on randomization. It means that you can       see the players do stupid things. My hope is to implememnt some rudimentary strategies in one of the players, see if some more sophisticated algo        can be implemented down the line.
2. Random Walker
   -> While the logic of a Random Walker is pretty straight forward, one thing that I havent implemented but really want is the ability for the walker         to change its course if the current move will lead it back to place that it has been.
